Running a household is hard work. Organization is not easy to achieve or maintain and time is short. We have tried many calendar and planning systems. Digital calendars provided the greatest benefit due to their integration with phones and instantaneous sync between family members. One downside is the lack of a single, large display that a traditional paper calendar might provide. This presented an opportunity to solve a real problem with a digital dashboard. The primary goal was to display the calendar on a screen where all family members could see it. Other possible benfits included the ability to display a todo list.">

<p>My home dashboard is the most successful home tech project I&rsquo;ve ever attempted. It was fun and rewarding. My family gets a lot of value out of it. My partner can&rsquo;t deny its usefulness.
The sales process and the evaluation phase of home projects is unforgiving. Family members don&rsquo;t have much regard for novel tools or techniques. They won&rsquo;t appreciate an elegant deployment system or clean code. They get value out of it or they don&rsquo;t.
The home dashboard.</p>
